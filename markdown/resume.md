Experience
---------
2015 -
:    **Developer and scrummaster, Sveriges Television AB**

The videocore team at SVT is responsible for transcoding and publishing all VOD content for SVT's online platforms. As a developer, i took part in development and maintenance of a system of microservices that handles transcoding, packaging and publishing of VOD content. The majority of the micrservices are built with gradle/kotlin/spring boot. Frequently used technologies are MariaDB, redis, elastic search and Apache Kafka. While mostly doing backend development, I also did some frontend development of internal tools with JS and React.

Starting in 2019, I also had the role of scrummaster in the videocore team. As a scrummaster, it was my responsibilites to help the team maintain and improve the agile process.

During my time at SVT I have aquired both solid knowledge about, as well as a keen interest in, the video encoding and streaming field.

Some of the highlights from my time at SVT:

* Building [Encore](https://github.com/svt/encore), our own open source transcoding solution based
on FFmpeg, and transitioning to use this for transcoding instead of our previous proprietary solution.

* Transitioning the video workflow from external packaging (dash/hls) to handling packaging
ourselves with shaka packager.

* Implemented hevc-transcoding to increase visual quality and decrease used bandwidth

2014 - 2015

[https://github.com/svt/encore](https://github.com/svt/encore)

**Vivict**
:   An easy to use in-browser tool for subjective comparison of the visual quality of different encodings of the same video source. Built with react and js.
